I have developed Python Code to play Hand Cricket

RULES OF HAND CRICKET:

* Whoever is choosing the toss should choose either heads or tails
* If they win the toss , they choose either batting or bowling
* Batting : [ Runs that are Considered : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] . You can play batting until you opponent player choose same number as you.
* Bowling : [ Numbers that are Considered : : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] . You can wicket the player if you choose same number as you opponent player
* At the end of the game we compare the scores of the players to announce the winner
